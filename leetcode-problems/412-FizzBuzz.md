# 412 Fizz Buzz

## Intuition
From the examples I realised that certain values such as `1` and `2` always occurred regardless of the input. In order for these values to occur, I understood that I had to apply the rules given in the exercise to all values from 1 to `n'.


## Complexity
- Time complexity: `O(n)`


- Space complexity: `O(n)`
