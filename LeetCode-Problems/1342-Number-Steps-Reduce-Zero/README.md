# 1342 Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero 

## Intuition
The numberOfSteps function works by repeatedly dividing the input number by 2 until it reaches 0. This means that the function will need to perform a logarithmic number of steps, since each step reduces the number by a factor of 2.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: `O(logn)`
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity:`O(1)`
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
