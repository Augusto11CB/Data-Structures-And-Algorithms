# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array

## Intuition
The biggest insight for this algorithm is to take advantage of the fact that the input array is sorted to compute the squares of each element and return a new array with the squared values sorted in ascending order.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: `O(n)`

- Space complexity: `O(n)`
