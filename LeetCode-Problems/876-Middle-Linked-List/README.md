## 876 Middle Linked List

## Solution 1
### Intuition
For the first solution, my interpretation of this problem was to use an array to store the values from the linkedlist to be accessed by index after determining the length of the list and its middle element using `n/2`, where `n` is the total length of the list. The lenght of the list is only determined when all elements of the list are traversed due to the nature of the linkedlist (linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations, unlike an array. Instead, each element in a linked list points to the next element in the list.)

### Complexity
- Time complexity: `O(n)`
- Space complexity: `O(n)`

## Solution 2
### Intuition

###
- Time complexity: `O(n)`
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
