# Graph Representations

Graph can be represented in two ways:

1. Adjacency matrix.
2. Adjacency list.



### Adjacency Matrix

It is a square matrix where the rows and columns represent the vertices of the graph, and the entries (elements) of the matrix indicate whether there is an edge between the corresponding vertices.



#### Adjacency Matrix for Undirected Graphs <a href="#adjacency-matrix-for-undirected-graphs" id="adjacency-matrix-for-undirected-graphs"></a>

For an undirected edge between vertices i and j, the corresponding entries in the matrix (A\[i]\[j] and A\[j]\[i]) will have a value of 1, indicating the presence of an edge. If there is no edge between vertices i and j, the matrix entries will have the value of 0.
