# Graph Knowledge to Solve Problems

### Problem - Find the smallest number of starting points to reach all nodes

Given a directed acyclic graph determine the smallest number of initial nodes such that you can access all the nodes by traversing edges.

In a directed graph, if a node doesn't have any incoming edges (in-degree of 0), then it means that the node cannot be reached from any other node. Hence, such nodes are mandatory starting points to ensure that every node in the graph can be reached.

### Problem - **Solving puzzles with only one solution**

**DFS** can be used to find a solution to a puzzle with only one solution, such as a maze or a sudoku.



### Problem - **Path Finding**

DFS can be used to find a path between two given nodes u and v.



### Problem - Test if a graph is strongly connected

**To Test if a graph is strongly connected**: DFS can be used to find out whether a graph is strongly connected or not.



### Problem - Find shortest path

**BFS** is useful for finding the **shortest path** in unweighted graphs and for&#x20;



### **Problem - Systematicaly exploring graph**

**BFS is useful for systematically exploring graphs**. Also, it can be useful for detecting cycles.
