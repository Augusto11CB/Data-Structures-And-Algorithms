# Matrix

A matrix is most commonly represented as a **two-dimensional array** in programming. Essentially, this means that a **matrix is** depicted as **an array of arrays**, where each sub-array represents a row containing multiple column elements. Thus, the primary array holds all the rows, making it possible to visualize the data in a grid-like structure reminiscent of a mathematical matrix.

```
A = [[1, 2, 3], 
     [4, 5, 6], 
     [7, 8, 9]]
```
